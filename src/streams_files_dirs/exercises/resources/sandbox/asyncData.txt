The Panther was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 medium tank and to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV.
Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war.
The Panther was a compromise. While having essentially the same Maybach V12 petrol (690 hp) engine as the Tiger I,
it had better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger I.
The trade-off was weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire and a weaker high explosive shell.
The Panther proved to be effective in open country and long-range engagements.
The Panther was rushed into combat at the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943 despite numerous unresolved technical problems,
leading to high losses due to mechanical failure. Most design flaws were rectified by late 1943 and early 1944, though the bombing of production plants,
increasing shortages of high-quality alloys for critical components, shortage of fuel and training space,
and the declining quality of crews all impacted the tank's effectiveness. Though officially classified as a medium tank, at 44.8 metric tons
the Panther was closer in weight to contemporary foreign heavy tanks. The Panther's weight caused logistical problems, such as an inability to cross certain bridges,
otherwise the tank had a very high power-to-weight ratio which made it highly mobile.
The naming of Panther production variants did not, unlike most German tanks, follow alphabetical order: the initial variant,
Panther "D" (Ausf. D), was followed by "A" and "G" variants.
