The Panther was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 medium tank and to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV.
Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war.
The Panther was a compromise. While having essentially the same Maybach V12 petrol (690 hp) engine as the Tiger I,
it had better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger I.
The trade-off was weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire and a weaker high explosive shell.
The Panther proved to be effective in open country and long-range engagements.
